### **Clustering Mall Customers using KMeans**

Welcome to the repository for my **second internship project** at **Prodigy InfoTech**! This project focuses on segmenting mall customers based on their annual income and spending score using KMeans clustering, as part of my ongoing internship tasks.

## **Project Overview**

In this project, we apply KMeans clustering to segment mall customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending behavior. This clustering helps in understanding customer patterns and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.

## **Google Colab Notebook**

All work for this project is documented in a Google Colab notebook named [`MallCustomerClustering_ML_Task_02.ipynb`](#). The notebook includes:

- **Data Preprocessing:** Steps for cleaning and preparing the dataset.
- **KMeans Clustering:** Implementation and evaluation of the KMeans clustering algorithm.
- **Visualizations:** Graphs and plots to illustrate the clustering results and customer segments.

## **Key Features**

- **Data Preprocessing:** Ensures the dataset is clean and normalized for clustering.
- **KMeans Clustering:** Applies KMeans to segment customers and determine optimal clusters.
- **Visualization:** Provides insights into customer segments through various plots, including elbow method and scatter plots.

## **Data Sources**

The dataset used in this project is the Mall Customers dataset available on Kaggle.

To download the dataset, use the following code in your Colab notebook:

```python
!pip install opendatasets
import opendatasets as od
od.download("https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python/data")
```

## **Installation & Usage**

To view and run the project:

1. Open the Colab notebook: [`MallCustomerClustering_ML_Task_02.ipynb`](#).
2. Run each cell to execute the code and see the results.

## **Results & Discussion**

The KMeans clustering model effectively segments the customers into distinct groups based on their annual income and spending score. The analysis provides valuable insights into customer behavior, which can inform targeted marketing strategies.

## **Future Work**

Future improvements may include exploring different clustering algorithms or incorporating additional features for more refined customer segmentation.
